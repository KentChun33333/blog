    "\n",
    "** 3.1.1 Introdution : **\n",
    "- This project is actually from 2011~2016. However, in 2016 this year, I bring a new scenario due to the project requirement. Therefore, I take advantages by carefully looking into the theory detail of this project, which inspires me a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "** 3.1.2 Workable Repository : **\n",
    "- Ying’s Project [here](https://github.com/ushadow/handinput) \n",
    "- It might be the most useful resource that you could reach on this project.\n",

    "** 3.1.3 Infrastructure : **\n",
    "- Elder computer, Win7 environmet. \n",
    "\n",
    "** 3.1.4 Supporting Documnet from 2015 Foxconn Jerry : **\n",
    "- Check with Win7 Desktop, there is a reimplementation document of Ying’s system by Jerry, the document is mainly written by Fox-Jerry, and modified by me. It might be the second useful resource that you could reach on this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition, anything about Markov Model related is in this project, if you want to chose this direction as the main target, I would suggest you to read the Ying’s thesis, also google the following Key-words :\n",

    " - Dynamic Time Warp Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "** 3.1.5 Notice : **\n",
    "- The elder computer is really unstable before I arrived MIT due to the fact of due-boot system. It spend me lots of time just to boot it in WIN7 mode. **I would suggest not to build your project on elder computer. **\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Ubuntu mode is actually builded by 2011~2014, a ancient project done by MIT-FOX members. I am not familiar about this. \n",

    "#### 3.2 Kinect upgrade and Python wrap : \n",
    "\n",
    "** 3.2.1 Introduction : **\n",
    "- Kinect 2 provide better resolution and more accurate joint-recognition algorithm in MS-SDK. It is quite nice to use it as the end-device in smart home or samrt conference scenarios.\n",

    "- young computer, win10\n",
    "- Kinetic 2 SDK is actually not compatible with any WIN version below Win8, and also the open-Ni, open-Kinect is actually not fully support kinetic 2. Therefore, we buy the young computer this year for integration the Kinetic 2.\n",

    "- You have to first connect Kinect 2 to the computer first of course. \n",
    "- I build the dependence of the system on young-computer, it should just work or you could open Kinect-SDK system \n",
    "- The py-wrap script is help to extract more information from MS-SDK in a pythonic way. If you are comfortable to use visual-studio, you might check other method to extract information.\n",

    "#### 3.3 Automated Opencv-Cascade CLI suit  (AOC-CLI suit) :\n",
    "\n",
    "** 3.3.1 Introduction : **\n",
    "- To have an object-detector, you don’t need to build it from scratch, the most common way is to use opencv-cascade trainer & detector. It is the fastest way for building an object-detector. In real production, there are lots of company still rely on  this workflow, due to its convenience & nice performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "** 3.3.2 Infrastrue : **\n",
    "- Actually in my personal computer MAC-OS-Yosemit, however, by simple midification, it shoud work in young computer.\n",

    "- Python 2 > 2.7 or Python 3 > 3.3 \n",

    "** 3.3.5 Notice : **\n",
    "- If you want to make my script work in young computer, just make sure \n",
    " - **opencv_traincascade** is callable in your command line interface. In young computer, I install the opencv source at **C:\\Users\\Davis\\opencv.**\n",
    " - Then modify linux-command such cat & mkdir & history to windows style (actually you do not need history function )\n",
    " - You have the right data-input structure described in the script\n",
    " - You execute the script at the right level of the data-input structure.\n",
    "- If keep failing, just check the usage-flow of opencv_traincascade, this script is just an automation of it.\n",

    "#### 3.4 HOG-SVM Object-Detector Suit (HSOD-suit) : \n",
    "\n",
    "** 3.4.1 Introduction : **\n",
    "- HOG-SVM is nice method for image-recognition and object-detection, therefor, I build an CLI suit on it. This project is actually extendable for a bag-of-features such as LBP, HAAR, HOG… etc. The HMM-DTW method to predict the objects trajectory.\n",

    "- Just read the README.md  in the project folder : \n",
    "- If don’t understand how to configure, google HOG theory might be helpful. The HOG is actually a well-defined, gradient-based, and vote-mechanism-style feature extractor. And the SVM is just a classification algorithm that best suit for binary-classification, there are also multi-class version.   \n",
    "- The performance of the detector is actually relying on your data-quality and hyper-parameters setting. There are lots hyper-parameters to tune.\n",
    "- The sklearn version would have impact on this subproject. If your version is too old or too new, I would suggest you to track the error and modify it to compatible in your version.\n",

    "\n",
    "** 3.5.1 Introduction: **\n",
    "- Recently [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640v5.pdf) and [SSD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325v2.pdf) have been seen as the most state-of-art algorithms on object detection in computer vision. They make a great progress on frame-per-second (FPS) with decent mean-average-perception (mAP).\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of their main strategy is actually to treat the detection problem as an regression. This ideal seems to be original from [OverFeat](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6229v4.pdf) and be strongly boosted by YOLO. Then SSD is a following work that combine the ideal with region-proposal-network from [FastRCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.08083v2.pdf) to make a trade-off on mAP vs FPS. \n",

    "\n",
    "** 3.5.4 Notice :**\n",
    "- Basically I used the Alexnet & VGGnet-based network structure a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The GPU is really unstable on young-computer, so I disable it. You could also consider to switch the system to Ubuntu. It might provide a more stable condition on GPU. However, there will be some trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you would like to install CUDA in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, you might check my [Blog Post](https://kentchun33333.github.io/InstallCUDAUbuntu.html#InstallCUDAUbuntu)\n",

    "## 4. Summary : \n",
    "Depending on capability, wishes, interests, project requirement and … so on, we probably would have different scenarios/problems/raw data to solve. Since it is all about data defining the solution, pick up something above that is useful to you. If it is insufficient, just create new one. This is exactly how I did this year, and I just saw how much the improvement on myself : ) \n",
