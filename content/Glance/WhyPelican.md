It has been a long time for considering to build a personal blog.

After tried lots of free-blog such as 

- Wix
- Wordpress 
- ...etc 

Benchmarked lots of static-generate-site suit such as : 

- Hexo (node-js)
- Hugo (go)
- Jekyll (Ruby)
- Pelican (python).

I just found that Pelican might be have the best support on ipython-notebook. So, I adopted the Pelican-suit for my personal blog.
