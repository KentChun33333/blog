It has been a long time for considering to actually build a blog of myself.

I've tried lots of free-blog such as Wix, Wordpress ... and also benchmarked lots of static-generate-site tools such as Hexo (node-js), Hugo (go), Jukely (Ruby) and Pelican (python).

After testing the flavors, I just found that current Pelican might be have the best support on ipython-notebook, which is the tool I really love. So, I adopted the Pelican-suit for my personal blog.
