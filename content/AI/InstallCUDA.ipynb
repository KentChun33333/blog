    "\n",
    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "To install CUDA is painful for most of people since most of data scientists or deep learning researchers are not familiar with system-side knowledge, include me. Few monthes ago, I've successed install CUDA in WINDOWS system, however, for some reasons, the WINDOWS-based version is no longer to satisfited my need. \n",
    "\n",
    "**I decided to switch my whole inframe-structure to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It took me almost 8 hours to sucessfully recover all my base-environment, and the most painful step is to install CUDA. Therefore, I decide to share my sucessful process step-by-step. Hope it will help some people : )\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 : Pre-installation just follow [officail guild](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/8.0/secure/prod/docs/sidebar/CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf?autho=1478535150_deefbbf1f764ec2a59a02727d0c95c05&file=CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf)\n",

    "- Download your relevant CUDA.run file such as **cuda_8.0.44_linux.run** and chmod 777 it \n",

    "### Step 2 : depreciate nouveau since it will cause confiction with Nvidia-driver\n",
    "\n",
